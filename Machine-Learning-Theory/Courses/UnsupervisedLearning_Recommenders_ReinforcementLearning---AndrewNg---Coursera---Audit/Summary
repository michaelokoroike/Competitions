The Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning course by Andrew Ng is the third and final course in the Machine Learning 
specialization on Coursera.

Week 1 introduces us to clustering (grouping data into clusters)/k-means and anomaly detection, which are forms of unsupervised learning.

Week 2 introduces us to recommender systems and things like collaborative fltering and content-based filtering, and principal component
analysis, all related to dealing with features and learning from them.

Week 3 introduces us to reinforcement learning and the state action value function, the Bellman equation, discrete vs continuous state
spaces, and proper algorithm refinement.

It is the course which really dives deep into the not as popular unsupervised learning methods, while showing their important uses and
their growth as methods in machine learning in things like robotics, etc.
