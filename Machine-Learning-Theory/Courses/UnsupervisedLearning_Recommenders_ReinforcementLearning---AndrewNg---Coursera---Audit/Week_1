WEEK 1: UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

* WELCOME TO THE COURSE!
  Welcome!
  **** *We will learn about clustering (grouping data into clusters) and anomaly detection, forms of unsupervised learning.    
       *We will learn about recommender systems in the second week, one of the most commercially important machine learning technologies.
       *We will learn about reinforcement learning in the third week.

* CLUSTERING
  What is Clustering?
  **** *Clustering looks at data points and automatically finds data points that are similar in some way, shape or form.
       *In unsupervised learning, you are not given y...can't tell an algorithm what is the correct algorithm; can only find interesting 
        aspects of the data. CLUSTERING algorithms look for structures in the data.
       *Applications of clustering are grouping news, market segmentation, DNA analysis, astronomical analysis, etc.
  K-means Intuition
  **** *What K-means does is assign points to cluster centroids and move cluster centroids    
       *First takes a random guess as to where are the centers of the clusters (CLUSTER CENTROIDS)
       *Second after the initial guess, it (K-means) will go through all of the data points and check which centroid it is closer/closest to
       *After this, it will look at all the points closest to a centroid and take the average of them, and therefore recompute the centroid
        as that average
       *It repeats until CONVERGENCE, where there is no more changes to centroid
