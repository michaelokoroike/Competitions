WEEK 2: RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS

* COLLABORATIVE FILTERING
  Making Recommendations
  **** *Example of predicting movie ratings; users making ratings from 1 to 5 stars
       *For recommender systems, there typically will be a number of users and a number of items
       *Notation: n_u is number of users, n_m is number of items, r(i,j) = 1 if a user has rated a movie in the example, y(i,j) = rating
        given by user j to to movie i (only if r(i,j) is 1)
  Binary Labels: Favs, Likes, and Clicks
  **** *Examples of binary applications = did a user purchase an item after being shown it, did a user like an item, did they spend
        more than 30 seconds with an item, etc? Yes or no answers
       *See video = becomes a logistic regression model
