The Supervised Machine Learning: Regression & Classification course by Andrew Ng is a course that introduces a learner to the basics of
machine learning.

Week 1 gives us a background of the field and its beginnings, and the future outlook of its impact on the economy, but more importantly delves
into the basic subtypes of machine learning, which are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Once we are apprised of the two subtypes
and given helpful examples of real world applications of each, we then purely focus on supervised learning.
