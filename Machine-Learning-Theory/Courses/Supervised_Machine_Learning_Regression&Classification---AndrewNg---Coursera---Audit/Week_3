WEEK 3: CLASSIFICATION

* CLASSIFICATION WITH LOGISTIC REGRESSION
  Motivations
  **** *Examples = Whether an email is spam (categories are Y/N), whether financial transactions are fraudulent (Y/N), is a cancer tumor
        malignant (Y/N). 
       *These are examples of BINARY CLASSIFCATION (y can only be one of two classes)...usually Yes/No, True/False, 0/1 
        (with 0 denoting false and 1 denoting True).
       *0 class = NEGATIVE CLASS (represents the absence of something); 1 class = POSITIVE CLASS (represents the presence of something). Can
        be arbitrary depending on the problem
       *Try to fit a straight line through this problem and it won't work...outlier examples can cause the best fit line to shift, and the
        threshold (DECISION BOUNDARY) also shifts even if it didn't need to
       *A way to try is by using a THRESHOLD (if below a value, predict 0; above a value, predict 1)
