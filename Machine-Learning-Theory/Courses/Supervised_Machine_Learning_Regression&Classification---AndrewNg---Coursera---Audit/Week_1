WEEK 1: WELCOME TO MACHINE LEARNING!

* OVERVIEW OF MACHINE LEARNING
  ** Machine learning is used in standard web searches, image recognition, recommendation, spam
  ** Also making its way into big companies and industrial applications (climate change solutions, diagnosis in healthcare, factory work)
  ** Machine learning = The science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed
  ** The earlier version of this course actually led to the founding of Coursera, interestingly!

* APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING
  ** We will learn about the important algorithms and the practical tips on making them work well
  ** Machine learning started as a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI)
  ** Examples of simple programming = Finding the shortest path from A to B (GPS)
  ** There was not a way to do interesting things like web search, recognize human speech, diagnose with x-rays, build self-driving cars...
     the only way it was understood that a machine could do things like this was to have it learn it by itself.
  ** Applications by A.N. = Speech recognition (Siri), Computer Vision (Google Maps), AI for augmented reality, payment fraud, 
     self-driving teams, healthcare, agriculture, ecommerce, and other problems.
  ** A.N. believes most industries will be touched by it in the near future
  ** Artificial General Intelligence is also expected down the line, but not soon
  ** AI is expected to add $13 trillion in value annually by 2030

* SUPERVISED VS UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
  What's machine learning?
  **** *Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed - Arthur Samule (1959)
       *Arthur Samuel wrote a checkers program (computer played tens of thousands of games against itself)
       *Two types of machine learning = supervised and unsupervised
       *Supervised learning used most in real-world applications; also unsupervised learning and recommender systems
  Supervised Learning Part 1
  **** *Supervised learning learns x to y (input to output mapping); you give your learning algorithm examples (right answers) to learn from
       *Examples of supervised learning = The input (x) of an email and the output of spam/not spam (y)...the application is spam filtering.
       *Another is x being audio and y being text transripts...the application is speech recognition.
       *Or x being English and y being Spanish...the application is machine translation.
       *Most lucrative application is in online advertising...x is info about ad/user info, and will you click on the ad or not (y).
       *Application of self-driving car...x is image, radar info, and y is finding the position of other cars.
       *Application of visual inspection...x is image of manufactured product (like cell phone), and y is determining if it's defected?
       *When models learn from these input/outputs, they can be given pairs they've not seen before and try to prodce the right output.
       *Different approaches to modelling (creating a straight-line model, a curve, or other).
       *Housing price prediction is an example of regression (predict a number out of an infinite possibility of numbers based on inputs),
        with house price being the desired output.
  Supervised Learning Part 2 
  **** *Recap = Supervised learning algorithms learn from input to output, or x to y mapping. Regression learns to predict numbers
        out of an infinite possibility of numbers.
       *Second type of supervised learning algorithm is the classification algorithm.
       *Example: Breast Cancer Detection. Classifcation models can predict if a lump in the breast is malignant (cancerous) or benign
        (nothing there). Dataset may have tumors of various sizes labelled as either benign or malignant; in that case there would only be
        two possible outputs (likely encoded as 0 or 1), as opposed to an infinite amount with regression.
       *You can have more than two outputs for classification. 
       *Output classes/categories = targets for classification problems.
       *Classification predicts categories/classes; could be no-numeric (image classifcation; cat or dog). It predicts from finite number of 
        possible values, as opposed to an infinte number of possible values with regression.
       *Can use more than one input to predict an output (ex: insead of just tumor size for breast cancer, tumor size and age).
       *In classification, model/algorithm, instead of a line of best fit, may find a boundary that separates different classes (like
        benign and malignant tumors).
       *Often many more than two input values are used/required...in breast cancer, other inputs typically used are thickness of the lump,
        uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape, etc.
       *Recap = Supervised learning algorithms learn from input to output, or x to y mapping...learning alorithms learn from the right 
        answers. Two major types of supervised learning: regression (predict number) and classification (predict categories); 
        regression has an infinite possible amount of output values, and classification has a finite amount of  output values.
  Unsupervised Learning Part 1
  **** *Recap = Supervised learning classification; each sample has an output label (breast cancer = benign or malignant).
       *In unsupervised learning, we're given data that doesn't have output labels; job is simply to find something interesting (pattern,
        etc)
       *Called unsupervised b/c we're not trying to supervise the algorithm to give a right answer...just find interesting patterns;
        this type of unsupervised learning is called CLUSTERING
       *Clustering can be found in things like Google news...looks at news items and groups related stories together; valuable in the sense
        it's not feasible to manually do this every moment of every day
       *Clustering can also be found in things like DNA microarrays; based on DNA sequencing, being able to group individuals
       *Clustering can also be in grouping ustomers to understand preferences, etc
