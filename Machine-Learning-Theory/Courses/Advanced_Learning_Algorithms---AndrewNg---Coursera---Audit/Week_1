WEEK 1: NEURAL NETWORKS

* NEURAL NETWORKS INTUITION
  Welcome
  **** *This course will teach us about neural networks (deep learning algorithms) and decision trees
       *Also we will learn practical advice on how to build machine learning systems (collecting more data; using a bigger GPU; etc)
       *This week we will learn inference from a neural network; next week is training; third week is the practical advice; final week is 
        decision trees
