The Advanced Learning Algorithms course by Andrew Ng is a course that introduces a learner to the more advanced algorithms and metrics of
machine learning. It is the coutse following the Supervised Machine Learning: Regression & Classification in the Andrew Ng machine learning
specialization program on Coursera.

Week 1 is really the introduction of the student to neural networks and the original intuition behind it, as well as informing us of
its structure in Tensorflow and real world uses. We are also introduced to vectorization.

Week 2 walks us through the implementation and introduces us to integral aspects of the implemenation, such as activation functions, etc.
We are inroduced to multiclass classification and how to use neural networks in those situations. We are introduced to other concepts in
neural networks (optimization, layer types, back propagation, etc).

Week 3 is essentially how to go about debugging neural networks and goes  through the different errors and how you would combat it; er are
introduced to the seminally important bias and variance errors which buttresses this analysis, and other tactics such as creating thresholds,
looking at learnings, transfer learning, adding data, error analysis, etc.

Week 4 introduces us to decision trees and the intuition to how they work, and involves the talk with Chris Manning.

I recommend the course, as it is more intution on the back of course 1.
