WEEK 2: NEURAL NETWORK TRAINING

* NEURAL NETWORK TRAINING
  TensorFlow Implementation
  **** *We are given the code that is used to code a neural network in TensorFlow
       *Step 1: Import tensorflow (and Sequential and Dense from tensorflow)
       *Step 2: Create the simple model (Sequential([Dense(units=25, activation='sigmoid')...])
       *Step 3: Ask tensorflow to compile and choose a loss function (ex: model.compile(loss=BinaryCrossentropy())
       *Step 4: Call the fit function (ex: model.fit(x, y, epochs=100)); epoch is determining how many steps (in gradient descent terms) you
        may want to run
       *Understand how algorithms and things work so that if the training doesn't work correctly initially, you can debug based on your 
        conceptual understanding of what you are doing
  Training Details
  **** *Recap = Loss function is error of one training example; cost function is average error over all training examples
       *The same model training steps done for logistic regression can be done for neural networks (specify how to compute model given input
        x and parameters w and b by defining the model; then specify loss and cost; then train on data to minimize cost)
       *Step 1: Create the simple model (model = Sequential([Dense(...), Dense(...), Dense(...)])
       *Step 2: Use model.compile to define the loss function (model.compile(loss='BinaryCrossentropy'))
       *Step 3: Call function to minimize the cost as a function of the parameters of the neural network (model.fit(X,y, epochs=100))
       *Go over Step 1 in detail; this defines the architecture of the neural network.
       *Go over Step 2 in detail; this specifies the loss function which defines the cost function used for the neural network. Typically
        same as for logistic regression, which is -y(i)*log(f_w[vec],b_(x[vec](i)))-(1 - y(i))*log(1 - (f_w[vec],b_(x[vec](i)))), where y(i)
        is the ground truth (target label) for a training example i, and f_w[vec],b_(x[vec](i)) is the neural network output prediction. In
        TensorFlow, this is referred to as binary crossentropy because the function itself is referred to as crossentropy and binary just
        reemphasizes that it is a binary classification problem. Example for a regression problem would be if you wanted to minimize a 
        squared error loss, and choosing model.compile(loss='MeanSquaredError()'). Cost is with respect to all of the parameters in a 
        neural network.
       *Go over Step 3 in detail; this runs gradient descent (epochs is number of steps to take). The key part of the computation is the
        partial derivative term; TensorFlow ses BACKPROPAGATION to compute the derivative terms.
       *Interesting note; Keras started out as its own project but was merged into TensorFlow. Libraries are mature so good to work
        with them, but also good to implement from scratch and know how things work under the hood.
