WEEK 3: ADVICE FOR APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING

* OVERVIEW OF MACHINE LEARNING
  Deciding What to Try Next
  **** *If you get large errors, you can...
        - Get more training examples
        - Try smaller sets of features
        - Try getting additional features
        - Try adding polynomial features
        - Try decreasing lambda
        - Try increasing lambda
       *This week we will learn how to carry out a diagnostic (a way to test what is or isn't working with an algorithm, to see what is or
        isn't working with a learning algorithm, to gain guidance to improving its performance). They can take time to implement, but are 
        very useful.
