WEEK 3: Sampling and Point Estimation

* LESSON 1 - Population and Sample
  Population and Sample
  **** *Samples often have to be used because we can't get a full consensus population survey (billions of people can't be surveyed)...sample comes from a population
       *Ask a subset and estimate
       *There is random sampling, which is the goto
       *Dependent random sampling isn't good...must start over if necessary
       *Samples need to be independently distributed; whatever rules used to pick one has to be used to pick another
       *Every dataset we use is a sample
