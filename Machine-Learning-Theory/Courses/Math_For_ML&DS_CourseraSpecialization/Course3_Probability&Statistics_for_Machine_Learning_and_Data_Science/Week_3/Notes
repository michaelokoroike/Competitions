WEEK 3: Sampling and Point Estimation

* LESSON 1 - Population and Sample
  Population and Sample
  **** *Samples often have to be used because we can't get a full consensus population survey (billions of people can't be surveyed)...sample comes from a population
       *Ask a subset and estimate
       *There is random sampling, which is the goto
       *Dependent random sampling isn't good...must start over if necessary
       *Samples need to be independently distributed; whatever rules used to pick one has to be used to pick another
       *Every dataset we use is a sample
  Sample Mean
  **** *Good to do random sampling for mean, because it avoids bias and allows each instance an equal opportunity to be chosen
       *Bigger the sample size, the better
  Sample Proportion
  **** *Population proportion = number of items with a given characteristic divided by the number of items in a population, denoted by P
       *Sample proportion = number of items in a subset of a population with a given characteristic divided by the number of items in that subset, denoted by P-hat
