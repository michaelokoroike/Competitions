WEEK 3: Confidence Intervals and Hypthesis Testing

* LESSON 1 - Confidence Intervals
  Confidence Interals - Overview
  **** *Example: In the world population, you'll never have a way to measure the ccurate height of every individual, you have to get samples and rely on those sample means...but
        YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY HOW ACCURATE YOUR RESULTS IN ARE ACCORDANCE TO THE REALITY OF THE POPULATION. This is where confidence intervals come in.
       *Confidence intervals allow you to use sample means with A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY.
       *Confidenc intervals have a lower and upper limit that contain the population parameters with degree of certainty.
       *Example is you lose your key along the side of the road, and you and your friend go to look for it. You give a best guess as to where it may be, and then decide on a search 
        distance east and west to rtry and find it in case the guess may not be correct (which it likely isn't on the dot correct); what actually matters is the search distance, and
        how large it should be, based on how confident you'll be with that search distance to actually find the key, which is expressed as a percentage. The lower and upper limits are 
        the bounds of the search. The key, importantly, is unknown and fixed, while the interval is random (the guess) and generated with desired (un)certainty.
       *Going off the example, a 50% confidence level means not that 50% of keys are the confidence interval, but that 50% of guesses are within a search distance of the key.
       *Going off the example, the true mean value is where the key is...it has an unknown and fixed value...we randomly generate a confidence interval to estimate where it is 
        located based off of a random sample from the population. Example would be taking the height of 1 person and going from there; measure their height and use it to generate pop.
        mean (the one person's height is the sample mean, or x-bar)...(x and x bar have same mean, though we don't know true meaning of x?)...can't knowif the person is taller or shorter
        than average, so question to ask is how far are most sample means from the true population means? if typical, our sample mean will be in that range; to answer this we need a 
        MARGIN OF ERROR (distance on either side of mean) and a CONFIDENCE LEVEL (probability that sample mean is within that margin of error); you get these values by starting with a 
        SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL (probability that sample mean falls outside margin of error)...confidence level is 1 - significance level
       *CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IS SAMPLE MEAN (X BAR) PLUS/MINUS MARGIN OF ERROR
       *WHEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL IS 95%, 95% OF CONFIDENCE INTERVALS PERTAINING TO EACH INDIVIDUAL EXAMPLE (LIKE WITH A PERSON AND THEIR HEIGHT, VS POP. MEAN) WILL CONTAIN THE POP. MEAN,
        WHILE 5% WON'T
  Confidence Intervals - Changing the Interval
  **** *Mean of sample means = population mean (in theory)...doesn't depend on sample size
       *Standard deviation of sample means = population standard deviation divided by square root of number of individuals in population...does depend on sample size (makes sense...the
        larger the sample size, the more acurate representation of the population, hence sample means are going to be closer to the population mean, hence less variation); graphically,
        this looks like the distribution getting taller and having more outcomes concentrated nearer to the mean...in this case, with confidence levels remaining the same, the difference
        is with higher sample size, the confidence intervals become smaller while still generating the same levels of accuracy, because you have a more precise estimate of the true value
        of the population mean
       *When confidence level is lowered, what happens is smaller margins of error are used, and because of this, there end p being more instances where overall cofidence interval(s) does
        not contain the true population mean...but of note is the actual distribution (which is of sample means generated) is not changed by confidence level
       *Summary of key points: 1) confidence intervals are a sample mean with a margin of error added to each side; 2) confidence level is the probability that a confidence interval
        contains the population mean (like 95%); 3) ideally we have high confidence and a narrow interval; 4) larger samples give narrower interval; 5) decreasing confidence level
        will decrease confidence interval
  Confidence Intervals - Margin of Error
  **** *Given a general case of a population with standard mean and variance; with goal of trying to find average height of population (standard mean), you take a sample of size n and 
        calculate the sample mean x bar; the sample mean is probably a little taller or a little shorter than the true poplation mean (it's a random variable with standard mean, but
        variance divided by population), but close enough; as sample size increases, that sample man is going to theoretically converge towards population mean (note, you still don't 
        actually know the population mean); to make a confidence interval (knowing outliers/etc are possible in sample), use knowledge 68% of normal distribution is within 1 sd of mean,
        and 95% of the distribution is within 2 sd, and this is where Z-SCORE comes in (example: point 1 sd above mean has a Z SCORE of 1, and point 1 sd below mean has Z SCORE of -1)...
        Z SCORE of a point is found by subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation (note; the standard nomal distribution is actually also called the Z DISTRIBUTION)
       *Actual Z scores for 2 sd are -1.96 (z_.025) and 1.96(z_.975), and are called CRITICAL VALUES
       *Knowing this, margin of error is sample mean +/- 1.96*sample standard deviation (populaion sd divided by sqrt of n number of samples; STANDARD ERROR)
       *All possible by Central limit Theorem (we can assume normality wity samples and population)
       *Note: What is standard deviation of a normal distribution?
  Interactive Tool: Confidence Intervals
  **** *What was shown in the video; multiple different intervals and 80% of them including the population mean
  Confidence Intervals - Calculation Steps
  **** *1) Find the sample mean
       *2) Define a confidence level
       *3) Get the critical value for this confidence level
       *4) Find the standard error (pop. standard deviation, divided by sqrt of n in sample pop)
       *5) Find the margin of error (criticsl value * standard error)
       *6) Add/subtractmargin of error to the sample mean
       *Assumptions - simple random sample, sample size > 30 or population is normal,
