WEEK 3: Confidence Intervals and Hypthesis Testing

* LESSON 1 - Confidence Intervals
  Confidence Interals - Overview
  **** *Example: In the world population, you'll never have a way to measure the ccurate height of every individual, you have to get samples and rely on those sample means...but
        YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE A DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY HOW ACCURATE YOUR RESULTS IN ARE ACCORDANCE TO THE REALITY OF THE POPULATION. This is where confidence intervals come in.
       *Confidence intervals allow you to use sample means with A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY.
       *Confidenc intervals have a lower and upper limit that contain the population parameters with degree of certainty.
       *Example is you lose your key along the side of the road, and you and your friend go to look for it. You give a best guess as to where it may be, and then decide on a search 
        distance east and west to rtry and find it in case the guess may not be correct (which it likely isn't on the dot correct); what actually matters is the search distance, and
        how large it should be, based on how confident you'll be with that search distance to actually find the key, which is expressed as a percentage. The lower and upper limits are 
        the bounds of the search. The key, importantly, is unknown and fixed, while the interval is random (the guess) and generated with desired (un)certainty.
       *Going off the example, a 50% confidence level means not that 50% of keys are the confidence interval, but that 50% of guesses are within a search distance of the key.
       *Going off the example, the true mean value is where the key is...it has an unknown and fixed value...we randomly generate a confidence interval to estimate where it is 
        located based off of a random sample from the population. Example would be taking the height of 1 person and going from there; measure their height and use it to generate pop.
        mean (the one person's height is the sample mean, or x-bar)...(x and x bar have same mean, though we don't know true meaning of x?)...can't knowif the person is taller or shorter
        than average, so question to ask is how far are most sample means from the true population means? if typical, our sample mean will be in that range; to answer this we need a 
        MARGIN OF ERROR (distance on either side of mean) and a CONFIDENCE LEVEL (probability that sample mean is within that margin of error); you get these values by starting with a 
        SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL (probability that sample mean falls outside margin of error)...confidence level is 1 - significance level
       *CONFIDENCE INTERVAL IS SAMPLE MEAN (X BAR) PLUS/MINUS MARGIN OF ERROR
       *WHEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL IS 95%, 95% OF CONFIDENCE INTERVALS PERTAINING TO EACH INDIVIDUAL EXAMPLE (LIKE WITH A PERSON AND THEIR HEIGHT, VS POP. MEAN) WILL CONTAIN THE POP. MEAN,
        WHILE 5% WON'T
