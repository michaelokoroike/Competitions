WEEK 1: Introduction to Probability and Probability Distributions

* LESSON 1 - INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY
  Course Introduction
  **** *Probability is important because a lot of algorithms in machine learning have results that can be phrased as a probability
       *Ex: spam detection outputs probability that an email is spam
       *Bayes Theorem = Calculate probability given certain events
       *Maximum Likelihood Estimation = Probability that modelgives you your data (squared error is used because you are using a Gaussian
        distribution which has a square...when you take the logrithm it has a square)
       *Regularization is important because when you start thinking about the probability of a model, there's another Gaussian there for the
        coefficients, which the squares of the regularization terms of the terms come out too (L2 regularization comes from a Gaussian
        distribution assumption)
       *Hypothesis testing is covered as well...also, confidence, confidence interval, p-value
  Check Your Knowledge
  **** *Understood the basic probability point...not sure about complement of probability...not sure about sum of probabilities...not sure
        about sum of proabilities, joint events...not sure about Bayes' Theorem...not sure about random variables...not sure about
        probability distributions...not sure about probability density function
  What is Probability?
  **** *Rules of probabiility and Bayes Theorem in Lesson 1; in Lesson 2 we'll learn about probability distributions
       *Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to occur
       *Ex: In a school with ten kids, 3 play soccer and 7 don't. Probability that the kid we pick at random plays soccer is 3/10, or 30%.
        Would be denoted as P(soccer) = soccer/total...the number of kids who play soccer is the EVENT, and the denominator total is the
        SAMPLE SPACE
       *Ex: On coin flips, P(heads) = heads/heads or tails; P(HH) = HH/HH*HT*TH*TT (flipping heads twice)
  What is Probability? - Dice Example
  **** *P(6) = 6/(1,2,3,4,5,6) = 1/6
       *P(66) = 6,6/((1,2,3,4,5,6)(1,2,3,4,5,6)) = 1/36
  Complement of Probability
  **** *Complement of probability is the probaility that an event does not occur; if an event has a 75% probzbility of occurring, then
        the complement of that event has a 25% probability of occurring
       *Ex: In a school with ten kids, 3 play soccer and 7 don't. Probability that the kid we pick at random doesn't play soccer is 7/10, 
        or 70%. Would be denoted as P(not soccer) = not soccer/total...the number of kids who play soccer is the EVENT, and the 
        denominator total is the SAMPLE SPACE...P(not soccer) = 1 - P(soccer).
       *Ex: Probability of not landing on heads three times is P(not HHH) = 1 - P(HHH) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.
       *Ex: Rolling a die, what is the probability of rolling anything other than 6? P(not 6) = 1 - P(6) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6.
  Sum of Probabilities (Disjoint Events)
  **** *Ex: Rolling a die, the probability of getting a 2 or a 3 is P(2 or 3) = 2,3/(1,2,3,4,5,6), or 2/6 (1/3)...the probability of
        rolling an even number or 5 is P(even number U 5) = P(even number) + P(5) = ((2,4,6)+(5))/(1,2,3,4,5,6) = 4/6 = 2/3
       *Ex: Kids can only play one sport....if P(soccer) is 0.3 and P(basketball) is 0.4, what is the probability that a kid plays
        soccer or basketball? It's 0.7 (P(soccer or basketball) = (0.3 + 0.4)/1.0); they can't be intertwined because you are only
        allowed to do one sport. (Notation = P(soccer U basketball) = P(soccer + P(basketball), where U stands for union/or).
       *Given the example of rolling a die twice and getting 7 or 10 (18/36...all different combinations)
  Sum of Probabilities (Joint Events)
  **** *Ex: Probbility of rain is 80% and probability of windiness is 70%...what's the probability of rain or wind? Adding them gets
        you 150%, and shows the fact they can happen at the same time (you can have rain and wind at the same time)...we're using
        SUM rule
       *Sum rule is used to calcuate the possibility of combined events
       *Ex: Kids can play as many sports as they want.....if P(soccer) is 0.6 and P(basketball) is 0.5, what is the probability that a 
        kid plays soccer or basketball? If P(soccer) is 0.6 and P(basketball) is 0.5 and P(soccer U basketball) is 0.3, how many kids play
        soccer or basketball (5 + 6 - 3) - 8...the kids who play soccer and basketball are accounted for in the 5 + 6 already, so we don't
        want to double count.
       *Disjoint events don't overlap, and are mutually exclusive...joint events do, and are non-mutually exclusive.
       *Ex: Probability of rolling two dice that sum to 7 or have a difference of 1...14/36 (4,3 and 3,4 overlap)
  Independence
  **** *P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
  Birthday Problem
  **** *In a party of 30, which is more likely, that no two ppl have the same birthday, or that at least two ppl have the same birthday?
       *Probability that they all have different birthdays is 365/365 * 364/365 * 363/365...until 336/335 (which gives us around 30%); the
        complement of this is the probability that at least two ppl share the same birhtday (1 - 30% = 70%)
  Conditional Probability - Part 1
  **** *Conditional probability = probability that an event happened given that another event has happened
       *Ex: Landing on heads twice in coin flip; P(HH) = P(H and H) = P(H) * P(H) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 (25%)
       *Ex: Landing on heads twice GIVEN the FIRST FLIP IS HEADS; P(H) = 1/2 (50%)...notation is P(HH | first is HH) = HH/((HH)(HT))
       *Conditional probability changes sample space
       *Ex: Proability that a first roll of a die is 6 and the next gives you sum of 10 = P(1st is 6 and sum of 2 is 10) = P(6)*P(4)
        = 1/6 * 1/6...P(sum is 10, given 1st roll is six)
  Conditional Probability - Part 2
  **** *Ex: School of 100 kids (50 soccer likers, 50 non-soccer likers) are told they have two options: go in a room with the World Cup
        on TV, or go in a room not watching it...we would expect all 50 soccer likers to go in the room with the World Cup.
       *In previous examples, the rooms and the liking of soccer or not were independent; when you add the variable of the World Cup
        being played in one of the rooms, it becomes two dependent variables (liking soccer and students' chosen room).
       *Ex: School with 100 kids (50 soccer likers, 50 non-soccer likers)...on any given day, 80% of the soccer likers wear running
        shoes...how many soccer students wear running shoes? P(S and RS) = P(S) * P(RS | S) = (50) * (.8) = 40. Also, 50% who don't like soccer
        wear running shoes; how many nonsoccer students wear running shoes? P(NS and RS) = P(NS) * P(RS | NS) = (50) * (.5) = 25.
        In the scenario, there's 4 scenarios...soccer students who wear running shoes (40), soccer students who don't wear running shoes
        (10), nonsoccer students who wear running shoes (25), nonsoccer students who don't wear running shoes (25).
  Bayes Theorem - Intuition
  **** *Used for spam recognition, speech detection, etc
       *Ex: 1,000,000 million people in a population...1/10,000 are affected by an illness. Test that is given is 99% effective (out of 
        100 sick people, 99 are correcctly diagnosed as sick...out of 100 healthy people, 99 are correctly diagnosed as healthy). If
        someone went to the doctor and tested sick, are they really sick?
       *Answer to above: in the 1,000,000 person population, only 100 are sick (1/10,000), and 99 are actually sick and diagnosed as such. The 
        probability that someone in the population that tested sick is sick is P(sick | diagnosed as sick)...99 are sick, and this is out
        of the pool of 99 people that are correctly diagnosed as sick, and the 9,999 that are healthy and incorrectly diagnosed as sick.
       *The math is best depicted in the arrow map infographic...in the 1,000,000 population, 999,000 are healthy and 100 are sick (the
        1/10,000 ratio); in the 999,900 that are healthy, because of the 99% effectiveness, 99% of this pool (989,901) will be correctly
        diagnosed as healthy and 1% of the pool (9,999) will be incorrectly diagnosed as sick...in the 100 that are sick, 99% (99) will be
        correctly diagnosed as sick, and 1% (1) will be incorrectly diagnosed as healthy; the probability that someone is sick GIVEN they
        were diagnosed as sick is those correctly diagnosed as sick (99) divided by the correctly diagnosed as sick (99) plus those
        incorrectly diagnosed as sick (healthy incorrectly diagnosed...9,999).
  Bayes Theorem - Mathematical Formula
  **** *Conditional probability = P(A | B) = P (A and B) / P(B)
