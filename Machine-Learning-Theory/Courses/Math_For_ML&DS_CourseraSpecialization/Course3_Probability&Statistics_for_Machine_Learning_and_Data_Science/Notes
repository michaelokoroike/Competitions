WEEK 1: Introduction to Probability and Probability Distributions

* LESSON 1 - INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY
  Course Introduction
  **** *Probability is important because a lot of algorithms in machine learning have results that can be phrased as a probability
       *Ex: spam detection outputs probability that an email is spam
       *Bayes Theorem = Calculate probability given certain events
       *Maximum Likelihood Estimation = Probability that modelgives you your data (squared error is used because you are using a Gaussian
        distribution which has a square...when you take the logrithm it has a square)
       *Regularization is important because when you start thinking about the probability of a model, there's another Gaussian there for the
        coefficients, which the squares of the regularization terms of the terms come out too (L2 regularization comes from a Gaussian
        distribution assumption)
       *Hypothesis testing is covered as well...also, confidence, confidence interval, p-value
  Check Your Knowledge
  **** *Understood the basic probability point...not sure about complement of probability...not sure about sum of probabilities...not sure
        about sum of proabilities, joint events...not sure about Bayes' Theorem...not sure about random variables...not sure about
        probability distributions...not sure about probability density function
  What is Probability?
  **** *Rules of probabiility and Bayes Theorem in Lesson 1; in Lesson 2 we'll learn about probability distributions
       *Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to occur
       *Ex: In a school with ten kids, 3 play soccer and 7 don't. Probability that the kid we pick at random plays soccer is 3/10, or 30%.
        Would be denoted as P(soccer) = soccer/total...the number of kids who play soccer is the EVENT, and the denominator total is the
        SAMPLE SPACE
       *Ex: On coin flips, P(heads) = heads/heads or tails; P(HH) = HH/HH*HT*TH*TT (flipping heads twice)
  What is Probability? - Dice Example
  **** *P(6) = 6/(1,2,3,4,5,6) = 1/6
       *P(66) = 6,6/((1,2,3,4,5,6)(1,2,3,4,5,6)) = 1/36
