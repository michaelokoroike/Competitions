WEEK 2: Describing Probability Distributions and Probability Distributions with Multiple Variables

* LESSON 1 - Describing Distributions
  Expected Value
  **** *We are shown weighted average (expected value)
       *Notation = E[X]
       *What is expected in the long-term?
       *Notation for expected value for discrete variables = sum of probability x for all p_x's; notation for expected value for
        continuous variables = sum of probability x for all f_x's of an integral (the un-derivative of a function over an interval...
        for example x^2 in an integral means the function to test is 1/3*x^3)
       *Difference between mean and median is discussed later; we learn about torque
  Other Measures of Central Tendency: Median and Mode
  **** *Median = Important because of outliers (Michael Jordan was an outlier for geography majors, made the average starting salary
        appear higher than in actuality); middle point in even distribution, or average of two middle ones
       *Mode = Outcome with the highest probability; in continuous distribution, outcome with the highest height
       *Mean = Average (wieghted usually)
  Expected Value of a Function
  **** *Weighted average is shown in the E[x^2] example, etc
       *In general, E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b...E[aX] = aE{X], and E[b] = b
