WEEK 2: Describing Probability Distributions and Probability Distributions with Multiple Variables

* LESSON 1 - Describing Distributions
  Expected Value
  **** *We are shown weighted average (expected value)
       *Notation = E[X]
       *What is expected in the long-term?
       *Notation for expected value for discrete variables = sum of probability x for all p_x's; notation for expected value for
        continuous variables = sum of probability x for all f_x's of an integral (the un-derivative of a function over an interval...
        for example x^2 in an integral means the function to test is 1/3*x^3)
       *Difference between mean and median is discussed later; we learn about torque
  Other Measures of Central Tendency: Median and Mode
  **** *Median = Important because of outliers (Michael Jordan was an outlier for geography majors, made the average starting salary
        appear higher than in actuality); middle point in even distribution, or average of two middle ones
       *Mode = Outcome with the highest probability; in continuous distribution, outcome with the highest height
       *Mean = Average (wieghted usually)
  Expected Value of a Function
  **** *Weighted average is shown in the E[x^2] example, etc
       *In general, E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b...E[aX] = aE{X], and E[b] = b
  Sum of Expectations
  **** *Ex: If you flip a coin (heads is $1, tails is nothing), then roll a die and win the amount you roll (ex: roll 1 and get $1, etc)
        what are the expected winnings?...it equals ($1+$0)/2 + ($1+$2+$3+$4+$5+$6)/6, or $4.
       *Ex: If there is a game where 3 people with three different names has their names in a bag, there are 6 different ways those three
        names can be distributed (one way with all three correct, and three other ways with 1 correct); as it would be a 6-run test with
        6 correct calculations, the expected number of correct assignments is 6/6 (which equals 1)
       *Easiest way to do above is E[Matches], and equal it to the sum of expectations for each person; because each person has 1/3 chance
        to pick their name in the 3 erson example above, the sum of expectations would be 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3, which equals 1. It ends up
        being 1/n, for n amount of times.
