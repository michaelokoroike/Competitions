WEEK 3: Vectors and Linear Transformations

* VECTOR ALGEBRA
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *Main topics are vectors and matrices, and their properties such as size/direction of a vector
       *Think of vectors and matrices as a lot like numbers, can be added, multiplied, divided, subtracted (together)
       *Just like numbers you can find the multiplicative inverse of a matrix (inverse of 2 is 1/2, for example), under 
        certain conditions
       *Matrices and vectors are essential in data sets
       *Will learn about linear transformations (can hlp you visualize matrices graphically)
       *Examples in real world/uses include AI generated images, image-to-text/text-to-image generations...all of this is
        derived from manipulating matrices, vectors and their operations
