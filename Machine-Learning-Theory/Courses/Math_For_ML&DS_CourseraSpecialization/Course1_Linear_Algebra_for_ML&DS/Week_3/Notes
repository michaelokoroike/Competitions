WEEK 3: Vectors and Linear Transformations

* VECTOR ALGEBRA
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *Main topics are vectors and matrices, and their properties such as size/direction of a vector
       *Think of vectors and matrices as a lot like numbers, can be added, multiplied, divided, subtracted (together)
       *Just like numbers you can find the multiplicative inverse of a matrix (inverse of 2 is 1/2, for example), under 
        certain conditions
       *Matrices and vectors are essential in data sets
       *Will learn about linear transformations (can hlp you visualize matrices graphically)
       *Examples in real world/uses include AI generated images, image-to-text/text-to-image generations...all of this is
        derived from manipulating matrices, vectors and their operations
  Check Your Knowledge
  **** *Didn't know distance between vectors, matrix that represents a transformation, compute the inverse of a matrix off 
        the bat
  Vectors and their Properties
  **** *Seen as arrows in a plane/higher dimensional place
       *Impoartant aspects are magnitude (size/direction)
       *Vector simply put is a couple of numbers
       *Number of coordinates in the vector is the dimension of the space in which it lives
       *Taxicab distance (two sides of triangle) vs helicopter distance (hypotenuse)...taxicab distance is "L1 norm" (|a| + |b|),
        helicopter distance is "L2 norm" (square root of (a**2 + b**2); default algorithm
       *Direction of a vector can be derived from coordinates; showed me need to target a little bit
  Sum and Difference of Vectors
  **** *Example of sum = u: (4, 1), v: (1, 3), u + v = (4+1, 1+3) = (5,4). The sum of (5, 4) creates a diagonal in a parallelogram
        between the vectors u and v.
  **** *Example of difference = u: (4, 1), v: (1, 3), u - v = (4-1, 1-3) = (3,-2). The difference of (3, -2) when translated matches
        the vector obtained by joining the points u and v.
       *General definition is sum/difference component by component
  Distance between Vectors
  **** *One measurement is L1 distance (|a| + |b|), and another is L2 distance (square root of (|a|**2 + |b|**2))
       *Example is u: (6, 2), v: (1, 5), where u - v = (6-1, 2-5) = (5,-3). L1 distance is |5| + |-3|, which is 8. L2 distance is
        square root of |5|**2 + |-3|**2, which is 5.8.
  Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar
  **** *Result of vector * scalar is an elementwise product (ex: (1,2) vector * 3 scalar = (1*3, 2*3) vector (3,6))
       *It's a stretcing of a vector...if the scalar is negative, it's a stretching and reflecting across the origin
  The Dot Product
  **** *Example is buying different foods at different prices and finding how much you spent in total (2 apples and 4 bananas, with
        an apple costing $5 and a banana costing $3...2*$5 + 4*$3 = $22)
       *Ususally first vector is a row and second is a column
       *L2-Norm is always the square root of the dot product between a vector and itself
       *Vector transpose; converts columns into rows, and rows into columns. Matrix transpose; the columns become the rows. 
        X * y-transpose is typically how two vectors are multiplied.
       *<x, y> is another notation of the dot product
  Geometric Dot Product
  **** *The angle between two vectors is a significant measure...there's actually a relationship between the angle between vectors and
        the dot product
       *Orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors ave a dot product of 0 (ex: u: (-1, 3), v: (6, 2)...-1*6 + 3*2 = 0); necessity for
        orthogonality.
       *Dot product between a vector and itself (<u,u>) is L2-Norm squared (|a|**2 + |b|**2); dot product between two orthogonal 
        (perpendicular) vectors (<u,v>) is always 0; 
       *Dot product of a vector and itself (u, u) is the norm squared over the product of the norm and itself; dot product of a vector 
        and a longer vector (u, v) in the same direction is similar (simply the product of the two norms u * v); if the vectors (u, v) 
        have an angle between them, basically same as the sentence before this one, but you have to perpendicularly project one vector 
        onto the other (u' * v)...this is where COSINE OF AN ANGLE comes in (u' * v is equal to u * v * cos of angle between vectors)
       *Geometrically a dot product is positive because the projection onto another vector has positive length; it is negative because
        the projection of a vector moves in the opposite direction of the major vector...therefore THE SIGN OF A DOT PRODUCT OF A
        VECTOR CORRESPONDS TO BEING ON A SIDE OF THE ORTHOGONAL VECTOR TO THE VECTOR IN QUESTION
