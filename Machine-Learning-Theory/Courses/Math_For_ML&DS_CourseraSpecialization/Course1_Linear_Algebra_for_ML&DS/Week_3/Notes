WEEK 3: Vectors and Linear Transformations

* VECTOR ALGEBRA
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *Main topics are vectors and matrices, and their properties such as size/direction of a vector
       *Think of vectors and matrices as a lot like numbers, can be added, multiplied, divided, subtracted (together)
       *Just like numbers you can find the multiplicative inverse of a matrix (inverse of 2 is 1/2, for example), under 
        certain conditions
       *Matrices and vectors are essential in data sets
       *Will learn about linear transformations (can hlp you visualize matrices graphically)
       *Examples in real world/uses include AI generated images, image-to-text/text-to-image generations...all of this is
        derived from manipulating matrices, vectors and their operations
  Check Your Knowledge
  **** *Didn't know distance between vectors, matrix that represents a transformation, compute the inverse of a matrix off 
        the bat
  Vectors and their Properties
  **** *Seen as arrows in a plane/higher dimensional place
       *Impoartant aspects are magnitude (size/direction)
       *Vector simply put is a couple of numbers
       *Number of coordinates in the vector is the dimension of the space in which it lives
       *Taxicab distance (two sides of triangle) vs helicopter distance (hypotenuse)...taxicab distance is "L1 norm" (|a| + |b|),
        helicopter distance is "L2 norm" (square root of (a**2 + b**2); default algorithm
       *Direction of a vector can be derived from coordinates; showed me need to target a little bit
  Sum and Difference of Vectors
  **** *Example of sum = u: (4, 1), v: (1, 3), u + v = (4+1, 1+3) = (5,4). The sum of (5, 4) creates a diagonal in a parallelogram
        between the vectors u and v.
  **** *Example of difference = u: (4, 1), v: (1, 3), u - v = (4-1, 1-3) = (3,-2). The difference of (3, -2) when translated matches
        the vector obtained by joining the points u and v.
       *General definition is sum/difference component by component
  Distance between Vectors
  **** *One measurement is L1 distance (|a| + |b|), and another is L2 distance (square root of (|a|**2 + |b|**2))
       *Example is u: (6, 2), v: (1, 5), where u - v = (6-1, 2-5) = (5,-3). L1 distance is |5| + |-3|, which is 8. L2 distance is
        square root of |5|**2 + |-3|**2, which is 5.8.
  Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar
  **** *Result of vector * scalar is an elementwise product (ex: (1,2) vector * 3 scalar = (1*3, 2*3) vector (3,6))
       *It's a stretcing of a vector...if the scalar is negative, it's a stretching and reflecting across the origin
