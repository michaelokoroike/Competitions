WEEK 3: Determinants and Eigenvectors

* DETERMINANTS IN-DEPTH
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *We will learn what determinants and singularity mean in the context of linear transfomations; then we'll learn one of the more
        powerful applications of linear algebra in the real world, eigenvalues and eigenvectors (used extensively in machine learning,
        particularly in principal component analysis, or PCA)
       *PCA is essentially a group of points that are bunched together to the point of their having a line of best fit...and those points being
        projected onto that line (which is why it's also referred to as dimensionality reduction...from a 2d plane to a line, for ex)...this
        method essentially uses less data while also capturing most of the information the original data captured). Put another way, this
        method reduces columns (dimensions) of a dataset while losing as little info as possible. Good for large datasets.
       *Path of learning will be 1) starting with a linear transformation like learned in week 3...2) find if the transformation is singular
        or not...3) then we will look at a geometric interpretation of the determinant (stretching and shrinking)...4) finally we learn
        properties of determinants (this is the path for linear transformations)
       *Path of learning for PCA will be 1) definition of a basis (group of vectors that define a space)...2) definition of a span (tells us
        what space we can access or generate with linear combinations of groups of vectors...ex is a single vector always spanning a line; 2
        elements not pointed in the same direction will always span a plane)...3) we will learn eigenvectors and eigenvalues (example of
        [2 1|0 3]*[1|0] = [2|0]...this equation can be translated to [2 1|0 3]*[1|0] = 2*[1|0], where [1|0] is the eigenvector and 
        [2 1|0 3] or 2 is the eigenvalue (which is essentially the number constant which the matrix represents in matrix form)
  Check Your Knowledge
  **** *Didn't understand the determinant question...the base question...the characteristic polynomial question...or the eigenbase
        question...knew none of the questions
  Singularity and Rank of Linear Transformations
  **** *Recap: Learned about singularity and non-singularity of matrices...as matrices correspond to linear transformations, these
        transformations also have singularity and non-singularity and rank (we will find out how to identify the different ones)
       *Non-singular transformations still cover every single point on the plane (points of the transformation are the image of the
        transformation)...singular transformations don't get sent to the entire plane, but to a line/point (cannot cover the entire plane
        like it could before the transformation); the singular transformations have a lower rank and dimension than non-singular
       *Note: Rank is the dimension of the image of the linear transformation
  Determinant as an Area
  **** *Recap: Learned how determinants showd singularity or non-singularity of a matrix...in linear transformations, it can be explained
        as an area, or as a volume. When the area/volume is zero, the matrix is singular.
       *Determinant of the matrix is the area of the image of the fundamental initial basis (typically described as [1 0|0 1]) after
        transformation
       *Determinant being positive or negative does not affect singulatiy/non-singularity
  Determinant of a Product
  **** *The determinant of a matrix product is the product of the determinants of the multiplied matrices (ex: matrix with a detwerminant of
        5 multiplied by a determinant of 3 will have a determinant of 15
       *This is because no matter the area you initially have, the transformation blows it up by a factor of the determinant
       *Det(AB) = det(A)det(B). If a singular matrix is multiplied by a singular or non-singular matrix, the product is a singular matrix 
        because a singular matrix's determinant is 0, and anything multiplied by 0 is 0.
  Determinant of Inverses
  **** *The determinant of a initial matrix's inverse is the inverse of the determinant of the initial matrix (ex: a matrix with a
        determinant of 5 will have an inverse matrix with a determinant of 0.2)
       *Det(A^-1) = 1/det(A). This is because if Det(AB) = det(A)det(B), then Det(AA^-1) = det(A)det(A^-1); Det(AA^-1) is Det(Identity Matrix),
        so Det(Identity Matrix) = det(A)det(A^-1). The determinant of the identity matrix is always 1, so it becomes 1 = det(A)det(A^-1).
        Then divide both sides by det(A) and you get Det(A^-1) = 1/det(A).
