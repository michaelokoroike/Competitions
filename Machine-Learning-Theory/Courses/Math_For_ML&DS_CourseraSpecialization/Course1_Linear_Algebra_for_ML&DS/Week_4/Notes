WEEK 3: Determinants and Eigenvectors

* DETERMINANTS IN-DEPTH
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *We will learn what determinants and singularity mean in the context of linear transfomations; then we'll learn one of the more
        powerful applications of linear algebra in the real world, eigenvalues and eigenvectors (used extensively in machine learning,
        particularly in principal component analysis, or PCA)
       *PCA is essentially a group of points that are bunched together to the point of their having a line of best fit...and those points being
        projected onto that line (which is why it's also referred to as dimensionality reduction...from a 2d plane to a line, for ex)...this
        method essentially uses less data while also capturing most of the information the original data captured). Put another way, this
        method reduces columns (dimensions) of a dataset while losing as little info as possible. Good for large datasets.
       *Path of learning will be 1) starting with a linear transformation like learned in week 3...2) find if the transformation is singular
        or not...3) then we will look at a geometric interpretation of the determinant (stretching and shrinking)...4) finally we learn
        properties of determinants (this is the path for linear transformations)
       *Path of learning for PCA will be 1) definition of a basis (group of vectors that define a space)...2) definition of a span (tells us
        what space we can access or generate with linear combinations of groups of vectors...ex is a single vector always spanning a line; 2
        elements not pointed in the same direction will always span a plane)...3) we will learn eigenvectors and eigenvalues (example of
        [2 1|0 3]*[1|0] = [2|0]...this equation can be translated to [2 1|0 3]*[1|0] = 2*[1|0], where [1|0] is the eigenvector and 
        [2 1|0 3] or 2 is the eigenvalue (which is essentially the number constant which the matrix represents in matrix form)
