WEEK 2: Solving Systems of Linear Equations

* SOLVING SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS: ELIMINATION
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *We'll learn how to solve systems of linear equations and how to manipulate matrices, to vastly simplify them
       *Uses of neural networks: image recognition, sound recognition, music generation, 
  Check Your Knowledge
  **** *Didn't know off the bat solving singular systems of linear equations/equations with more variables, how to tell if a matrix is
        in row echelon form or reduced row echelon form, the rank of a matrix, or the operations that can be done in a row of a matrix
        to preserve singularity
  Solving Non-Singular Systems of Linear Equations
  **** *Take every system and turn it into a solved system
       *Involves manipulating equations by swapping equations, adding equations, multiplying equations by a constant    
       *Multiplying by a constant example (a + b = 10 * (7 purchases of the combination))
       *Adding equations example (a + b = 10; 2a + 3b = 22; sum = 3a + 4b = 32)
       *Eliminating variables (5a + b = 17; 4a - 3b = 6; divide each equation until there's 1a ---> a + .2b = 3.4, a - 0.75b = 1.5 --->
        0a - 0.95b = -1.9 and b = 2 (when you subtract the two equations)
  Solving Singular Systems of Linear Equations
  **** *Singular = redundant/contradictory
       *Eliminate a variable from the equation by dividing to get 1x for each x in the equations, for example
       *Anything you do towards one variable eliminates the other because the system is singular/redundant (imagine a line where you take
        an axis...it becomes a point!
       *Example : a + b = 10, 2a + 2b = 20; dividing by coefficient of a to get a + b = 10, a + b = 10; subtracting 1 from the other gets
        0 = 0 so we gain no new information from the system; solution is a = a, b = 10 - a)
       *Example : a + b = 10, 2a + 2b = 24; dividing by coefficient of a to get a + b = 10, a + b = 12; subtracting 1 from the other gets
        0 = 2 so we have a contradiction!)
  Solving Systems of Equations with More Variables
  **** *1st, divide each row by the coefficient of a variable; next, use an equation to remove a variable from the other equations; divide
        the reduced rows by one of its remaining variables, and use one of the equations to remove the divided variable from the other; 
        you find the answer to one of the variables, then go backward while finding the value of all of the variables
       *I get it...reduced (ormaybe just row echelon form) is just an efficient way of solving a system of equations...called the
        "ELIMINATION METHOD"
  Interactive Tool: Graphical Representation of Linear Systems with 3 Variables
  **** *The difference between linear systems with 3 variables having one solution (non-singular) and none solutions (singular) is
        with one soution, all 3 planes intersect, but with no solutions, there is no single point where all 3 intersect (although there are
        points where 2 of the 3 planes intersect)...with no solutions, it's almost like two of the planes are more oriented along the same
        axis, while with one solution it's like each plane is oriented in different directions
       *For the solution of a system to be a line, all the planes need to be perpendicular to each other and have a line where they all
        intersect...one independent/free variable
       *For the solution to be a plane, the equations in the system are all one plane (redundant)...two or more independent/free variables
       *For the solution to be all space, the equations in the system must have 0 as values (any coordinates will all add to 0 in each 
        equation)
       *Note: Free variables are the amount of variables that can be freely moved in an equation, while the other variables' values are
        dictated by the movement of those variables...what are known as degrees of freedom
       *Note: WHen looking at planes, the extra axis (outside of x and y) is literally a method of measurement (ex: eq is 3x + 2y = z...if
        x is 1 and y is 1, then in a depiction of a plane, you see a line where there is a third axis equalling the sum. The best way to
        put it is, when it is a line y is depending on x and vice versa technically...when it is a plane, any y is allowed for any x and
        vice versa.
       *Note: The key to understanding the plane id the implicit formula; the trajectory is based on where the plane equalled zero (for 
        example, a plane like z = 3x + 2y; the implicit formula is 3x + 2y - z = 0...the edges of the plane would be wherever the x and y
        part of the equation equal 0, in conjunction with z equalling 0; example is (0, 0, 0), (1, -3/2, 0), (-1, 3/2, 0)...it should be 
        recognized that a plane is simply what you get when you take the formula z = 3x + 2y and start it from every point on the x-axis,
        the origin of which is discovered as stated before with the implicit formula 3x + 2y - z = 0...the line projecting from each point 
        is the same because the step of y remains the same (and these are called normal vectors, when in Ax + By + Cz = D form like
        3x + 2y - z = 0, D is 0 and the remaining coefficients are treated as a vector from the origin, meaning the z term is 0). The
        normal vector
       *Random note = If two things are facing the same direction and on the same axis, they are not facing towards each other
       *Note: Gradient vector notes = https://www.kristakingmath.com/blog/gradient-vectors-and-the-tangent-plane
  Matrix Row-Reduction
  **** *AKA Gaussian elimination; essentially solving linear equations by manipulating them
       *Row echelon form is [1 0.2 || 0 1], reduced row echelon form is [1 0 || 0 1]...with row echelon, to the right of the main diagonal,
        any number is allowed; with reduced row echelon, all 0s above that main diagonal
  Row Operations that Preserve Singularity
  **** *Same manipulations of systems of linear equations can be used for matrices
       *Row operations preserve singularity
       *Recap; nonzero determinist values are non-singular
       *Rows in a matrix can be switched and maintain singularity/non-singularity; also can be added together

* SOLVING SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS: ROW ECHELON FORM AND RANK
  The Rank of a Matrix
  **** *Use of ranking machine learning is image compression for example; images can take a lot of storage because every pixel intensity
        has to be stored as a number...but you can store slightly blurrier images using significantly less space
       *Singular Value Decomposition can reduce the rank of a matrix while changing the matrix as little as possible
       *Rank is essentially how many pieces of information an equation has (exs: for the two equations a + b = 10, 2a + 2b = 20, the rank 
        is 1 because it is redundant; for the two equations a + b = 10, a + 2b = 12, the rank is 2 because there are two pieces of info;
        for the two equations 0a + 0b = 0, 0a + 0b = 0, the rank is 0 because there's no information
       *Solution space for a matrix = the solution(s) to the system of equations when the constants are zero (exs: for the 
        a + b = 10, a + 2b = 12 non-singular example, the matrix is [1 1 || 1 2], with 1 and 1 corresponding to a, and 1 and 2 
        corresponding to b...the only (a,b) that can simultaneously solve both equations would be (0,0); the dimensional solution space is
        0 because the dimension of a point is 0. For the a + b = 10, 2a + 2b = 20 singular example, the matrix is [1 1 || 2 2], with 1 
        and 2 corresponding to a and b...the 2 and 2 is a multiple of the 1 and 1 so we can think of it in that term...any (a,b) work where 
        a is the opposite of b and vice versa, like 4 and -4, 1 and -1, etc, and this creates a line...the dimensional solution space is 1 
        because the dimension of a line is 1. For all 0s in a matrix, the dimensional solution space would be 2 because you could plug in 
        any a or b as a solution to arrive at constant 0.
       *In the above case, rank equals 2 - (dimension of solution space)...this is how it works for a 2x2 matrix.
