WEEK 2: Solving Systems of Linear Equations

* SOLVING SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS: ELIMINATION
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *We'll learn how to solve systems of linear equations and how to manipulate matrices, to vastly simplify them
       *Uses of neural networks: image recognition, sound recognition, music generation, 
  Check Your Knowledge
  **** *Didn't know off the bat solving singular systems of linear equations/equations with more variables, how to tell if a matrix is
        in row echelon form or reduced row echelon form, the rank of a matrix, or the operations that can be done in a row of a matrix
        to preserve singularity
  Solving Non-Singular Systems of Linear Equations
  **** *Take every system and turn it into a solved system
       *Involves manipulating equations by swapping equations, adding equations, multiplying equations by a constant    
       *Multiplying by a constant example (a + b = 10 * (7 purchases of the combination))
       *Adding equations example (a + b = 10; 2a + 3b = 22; sum = 3a + 4b = 32)
       *Eliminating variables (5a + b = 17; 4a - 3b = 6; divide each equation until there's 1a ---> a + .2b = 3.4, a - 0.75b = 1.5 --->
        0a - 0.95b = -1.9 and b = 2 (when you subtract the two equations)
  Solving Singular Systems of Linear Equations
  **** *Singular = redundant/contradictory
       *Eliminate a variable from the equation by dividing to get 1x for each x in the equations, for example
       *Anything you do towards one variable eliminates the other because the system is singular/redundant (imagine a line where you take
        an axis...it becomes a point!
       *Example : a + b = 10, 2a + 2b = 20; dividing by coefficient of a to get a + b = 10, a + b = 10; subtracting 1 from the other gets
        0 = 0 so we gain no new information from the system; solution is a = a, b = 10 - a)
       *Example : a + b = 10, 2a + 2b = 24; dividing by coefficient of a to get a + b = 10, a + b = 12; subtracting 1 from the other gets
        0 = 2 so we have a contradiction!)
  Solving Systems of Equations with More Variables
  **** *1st, divide each row by the coefficient of a variable; next, use an equation to remove a variable from the other equations; divide
        the reduced rows by one of its remaining variables, and use one of the equations to remove the divided variable from the other; 
        you find the answer to one of the variables, then go backward while finding the value of all of the variables
       *I get it...reduced (ormaybe just row echelon form) is just an efficient way of solving a system of equations...called the
        "ELIMINATION METHOD"
  Interactive Tool: Graphical Representation of Linear Systems with 3 Variables
  **** *The difference between linear systems with 3 variables having one solution (non-singular) and none solutions (singular) is
        with one soution, all 3 planes intersect, but with no solutions, there is no single point where all 3 intersect (although there are
        points where 2 of the 3 planes intersect)...with no solutions, it's almost like two of the planes are more oriented along the same
        axis, while with one solution it's like each plane is oriented in different directions
       *For the solution of a system to be a line, all the planes need to be perpendicular to each other and have a line where they all
        intersect...one independent/free variable
       *For the solution to be a plane, the equations in the system are all one plane (redundant)...two or more independent/free variables
       *For the solution to be all space, the equations in the system must have 0 as values (any coordinates will all add to 0 in each 
        equation)
       *Note: Free variables are the amount of variables that can be freely moved in an equation, while the other variables' values are
        dictated by the movement of those variables...what are known as degrees of freedom
       *Note: WHen looking at planes, the extra axis (outside of x and y) is literally a method of measurement (ex: eq is 3x + 2y = z...if
        x is 1 and y is 1, then in a depiction of a plane, you see a line where there is a third axis equalling the sum. The best way to
        put it is, when it is a line y is depending on x and vice versa technically...when it is a plane, any y is allowed for any x and
        vice versa.
       *Note: The key to understanding the plane id the implicit formula; the trajectory is based on where the plane equalled zero (for 
        example, a plane like z = 3x + 2y; the implicit formula is 3x + 2y - z = 0...the edges of the plane would be wherever the x and y
        part of the equation equal 0, in conjunction with z equalling 0; example is (0, 0, 0), (1, -3/2, 0), (-1, 3/2, 0)...it should be 
        recognized that a plane is simply what you get when you take the formula z = 3x + 2y and start it from every point on the x-axis,
        the origin of which is discovered as stated before with the implicit formula 3x + 2y - z = 0...the line projecting from each point 
        is the same because the step of y remains the same (and these are called normal vectors, when in Ax + By + Cz = D form like
        3x + 2y - z = 0, D is 0 and the remaining coefficients are treated as a vector from the origin, meaning the z term is 0). The
        normal vector
       *Random note = If two things are facing the same direction and on the same axis, they are not facing towards each other
       *Note: Gradient vector notes = https://www.kristakingmath.com/blog/gradient-vectors-and-the-tangent-plane
  Matrix Row-Reduction
  **** *AKA Gaussian elimination; essentially solving linear equations by manipulating them
       *Row echelon form is [1 0.2 || 0 1], reduced row echelon form is [1 0 || 0 1]...with row echelon, to the right of the main diagonal,
        any number is allowed; with reduced row echelon, all 0s above that main diagonal
  Row Operations that Preserve Singularity
  **** *Same manipulations of systems of linear equations can be used for matrices
       *Row operations preserve singularity
       *Recap; nonzero determinist values are non-singular
       *Rows in a matrix can be switched and maintain singularity/non-singularity; also can be added together

* SOLVING SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS: ROW ECHELON FORM AND RANK
  The Rank of a Matrix
  **** *Use of ranking machine learning is image compression for example; images can take a lot of storage because every pixel intensity
        has to be stored as a number...but you can store slightly blurrier images using significantly less space
       *Singular Value Decomposition can reduce the rank of a matrix while changing the matrix as little as possible
       *Rank is essentially how many pieces of information an equation has (exs: for the two equations a + b = 10, 2a + 2b = 20, the rank 
        is 1 because it is redundant; for the two equations a + b = 10, a + 2b = 12, the rank is 2 because there are two pieces of info;
        for the two equations 0a + 0b = 0, 0a + 0b = 0, the rank is 0 because there's no information
       *SOLUTION SPACE for a matrix = the solution(s) to the system of equations when the constants are zero (exs: for the 
        a + b = 10, a + 2b = 12 non-singular example, the matrix is [1 1 || 1 2], with 1 and 1 corresponding to a, and 1 and 2 
        corresponding to b...the only (a,b) that can simultaneously solve both equations would be (0,0); the dimensional solution space is
        0 because the dimension of a point is 0. For the a + b = 10, 2a + 2b = 20 singular example, the matrix is [1 1 || 2 2], with 1 
        and 2 corresponding to a and b...the 2 and 2 is a multiple of the 1 and 1 so we can think of it in that term...any (a,b) work where 
        a is the opposite of b and vice versa, like 4 and -4, 1 and -1, etc, and this creates a line...the dimensional solution space is 1 
        because the dimension of a line is 1. For all 0s in a matrix, the dimensional solution space would be 2 because you could plug in 
        any a or b as a solution to arrive at constant 0.
       *In the above case, rank equals 2 - (dimension of solution space)...this is how it works for a 2x2 matrix.
  The Rank of a Matrix in General
  **** *Rank in general is a measure of how non-singular a matrix is (how many unique pieces of information in it...number of independent
        equations)
       *The key is an equation isn't independent if there's a way to obtin them from the other two (exs: for the three equations a + b + c = 0, a + 2b + c = 0, a + b + 2c = 0,
        there's no way to obtain any one of them out of the other two, therefore there are 3 equations and 3 pieces of information, which means a rank of 3. But
        for the three equations a + b + c = 0, a + b + 2c = 0, a + b + 3c = 0, the second equation is an average of the other two, so it's only 2 unique pieces of information
        and rank 2. a + b + c = 0, 2a + 2b + 2c = 0, 3a + 3b + 3c = 0 are all multiples of each other and is only 1 piece of information (rank 1). All 0s is rank 0.
       *Another way to do it is with the row echelon form of the matrix.
  Row Echelon Form
  **** *To get into row echelon form, divide all rows by leftmost coefficients; then subtract the bottom equation by the top and replace the bottom with the new one; then divide 
        the bottom row by the leftmost nonzero coefficient. For a 2x2 matrix, this gets you row echelon form. This is also notedly for NON-SINGULAR matrices; SINGULAR matrices
        end up with 0s on the bottom and the final divide step discussed in the last sentence.
       *Depending on how many 1s are in the diagonal determines how many ones are in the diagonal of a matrix in row echelon form...a matrix is NON-SINGULAR if and only if its
        diagonal has all ones and no zeroes
       *Note (my tangling with it in my head); when you get to row echelon form, you theoretically should have a variable solved, if it is a non-singular matrix
  Row Echelon Form in General
  **** *Note: It should be noted that 1s in the diagonal are unnecessary in row echelon form...they are only necessary in reduced row echelon form. Also, in reduced version, all
        numbers under and above the main diagonal should be zeroed it; in row echelon form, it's only the numbers below it
       *For the form, all rows with only zeroes need to go at the bottom; every row also has a leftmost nonzero entry (called pivots)...each pivot must be to the right of the
        pivots of the rows above it
       *Rank is number of pivots in a matrix in row echelon form
       *Note: This class will use number as pivots only.
       *Note: SINGULAR matrices have less pivots than number of columns (less unique pieces of information than actual total pieces of information)
  Reduced Row Echelon form
  **** *Reduced version,as stated before, is essentially row echelon form, but all of the numbers in the main diagonal are 1, and all numbers both below and above the main diagonal 
        are zero.
  The Gaussian Elimination Algorithm
  **** *This algorithm is essentially getting a system of equations down to reduced row echelon form. This is done on an AUGMENTED MATRIX (matrix with constants; for example,
        in the equations a + b + c = 1, a + 2b + c = 1, a + b + 2c = 1, the "constant" for all three equations is 1). This solves the system of equations.
       *Note: If a matrix is SINGULAR, in reduced row echelon form, one of the rows will be all zeroes. At that point you will know there is no solution to the system and you can
        stop right there...but you can still determine if the matrix is contradictory and has no solutions, or has infinitely many solutions by looking at the column of constants;
        if the constant in the row(s) of zero is also zero, then it ends up being 0a + 0b + 0c = 0, and in this type of equation, there are infinitely many solutions...
        if the constant in the row(s) of zero is not zero, then it ends up being 0a + 0b + 0c = 10 for example, in this type of equation, there are no solutions.
       *Note: BACK SUBSTITUTION is what you do when an augmented matrix is in reduced row echelon form and you have the value of one of the variables which solves the system of
        equations.
