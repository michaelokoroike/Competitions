WEEK 2: Solving Systems of Linear Equations

* SOLVING SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS: ELIMINATION
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *We'll learn how to solve systems of linear equations and how to manipulate matrices, to vastly simplify them
       *Uses of neural networks: image recognition, sound recognition, music generation, 
  Check Your Knowledge
  **** *Didn't know off the bat solving singular systems of linear equations/equations with more variables, how to tell if a matrix is
        in row echelon form or reduced row echelon form, the rank of a matrix, or the operations that can be done in a row of a matrix
        to preserve singularity
  Solving Non-Singular Systems of Linear Equations
  **** *Take every system and turn it into a solved system
       *Involves manipulating equations by swapping equations, adding equations, multiplying equations by a constant    
       *Multiplying by a constant example (a + b = 10 * (7 purchases of the combination))
       *Adding equations example (a + b = 10; 2a + 3b = 22; sum = 3a + 4b = 32)
       *Eliminating variables (5a + b = 17; 4a - 3b = 6; divide each equation until there's 1a ---> a + .2b = 3.4, a - 0.75b = 1.5 --->
        0a - 0.95b = -1.9 and b = 2 (when you subtract the two equations)
