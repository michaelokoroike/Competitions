WEEK 1: Systems of Linear Equations

* SPECIALIZATION & COURSE INTRODUCTION
  Specialization Introduction
  **** *Introduced to what to expect in all three courses of the specialization. The first one, this Linear Algebra course for Machine Learning
        and Data Science, teaches us how to use vectors and matrices to store and compute on data and to build systems of linear equations by 
        writing code and using these data structures to transform data efficiently. 
       *The second one, Calculus for Machine Learning, teaches us optimization methods like gradient descent and Newton's method. 
       *The third and final one, Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning and Data Science, we learn about probability and 
        distributions, and concepts like p-values and maximum likelihood estimation.
  Course Introduction
  **** *Introduced to what to expect in this course. From the transcript, "In the first week you will construct systems of equations from real 
        life examples and identify the matrix representation corresponding to these systems. From there, you will determine some important 
        concepts such as singularity and linear independence. You will also learn to calculate the determinant and you'll learn some useful 
        row operations for simplifying matrices."
       *"By the end of week two you will be comfortable solving two by two and three by three systems of equations, and you'll be familiar with 
         concepts such as the rank of a matrix."
       *"In week three, we will swim into the depth of the simplest representation of a greater values, the vector, and how matrices can transform 
         one vector into another."
       *"And in week four, you will learn some more advanced concepts such as eigen values and eigen vectors."
  What to Expect and How to Succeed
  **** *All that is recommended; solve a simple equation with one unknown variable (2x + 7 = 17, for example), and know how to construct 
        simple plots in the coordinate system (plot y = x, for example).
