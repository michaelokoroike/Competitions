WEEK 1: Derivatives and Optimization

* LESSON 1: DERIVATIVES
  Course Introduction
  **** *We will learn about derivatives, what they mea, how it works, how is it used in machine learning. Learn about advanced
        techniques in Newton's method
       *Machine learning is a lot of minimizing and maximizing functions...this is the main point of calculus (this minimizing and
        maximizing is done with derivatives).
       *Large fraction of machine learning is creating a cost function and minimizing it (this is calculus)...when you want to train 
        a machine learning model, you see the error and try to minimize it using derivatives, gradients, and more.
       *The optimizers are based on calculus.
       *Gradient descent is taking small steps to get lower and lower values.
       *Data can be very high dimensional and move in all different directions.
       *Newton's method is a way to minimize functions as an alternative to gradient descent.
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *We'll learn the intuition behind concept of derivative; example is velocity (
       *We'll also learn about linear functions, constant functions, quadratic polynomials, exponential functions, and logarithmic
        functions...we'll learn the derivatives of these
       *We'll learn sum rule, product rule, chain rule, and multiplication by scalars...to find derivatives of more complex functions
       *Derivatives are used to optimize functions (maximize or minimize them)
       *We'll learn about square loss and log loss (two most important loss functions in machine learning)
       *Video shows with line of best fit, you are given the method of predcting a value in a regression problem...shown the difference
        for regression and classification...going to learn the math underlying concepts4
  Motivation to Derivatives - Part 1
  **** *First thing when he thinks abut derivatives is velocity; a derivative is a instantaneous change of rate of a function...in driving
        the function is distance and the derivative is velocity
       *Note: Slope is change in distance/change in time
  Derivatives and Tangents
  **** *The derivative of a function at a point is the slope of the tangent at that point
  Slopes, Maxima and Minima
  **** *Horizontal lines have a slope of zero
       *Max or min of a function occurs where the derivative is zero
  Derivatives and their Notation
  **** *This video shows two ways to express a derivative; Leibniz's notation and LaGrande's notation
       *Recap that slope is defined by change in distance over change in time...can also be known as delta_x / delta_t...slope at a 
        point is dx/dt
       *Works by recalculating slpe at a point until the interval between delta_x and delta_t is so tiny that we officially have the
        tangent line
       *If y = f(x)...the notation y = f'(x) is LaGrange's Notation; dy/dx, or d/dx*f(x), is Leibniz's selection
  Some Common Derivatives - Lines
  **** *Goal is to be able to calulate derivatives of most functions
       *Constant/linear/quadratic
  Some Common Derivatives - Quadratics
  **** *The simplest quadratic is the parabola y = x**2, with the slope being the change of f (delta_f) over the change of x (delta_x), 
        as the change of x (delta_x) goes to 0
       *The slope can also be written as ((x + delta_x)**2 - (x)**2)/delta_x; in the example of y = x**2, if you decrease delta_x, delta_f
        decreases, and at x is 1, f approaches 2; so the slope at the tangent is 2
  Some Common Derivatives - Higher Degree Polynomials
  **** *A cubic function is y = x**3, in the shape of a long sguiggly vertical line, with the slope being the change of f (delta_f) over 
        the change of x (delta_x), as the change of x (delta_x) goes to 0
       *The slope can be written as ((x + delta_x)**3 - (x)**3)/delta_x; in the example of y = x**3, if you decrease delta_x, delta_f
        decreases, and at x is 1, f approaches 2; so the slope at the tangent is 3
  Some Common Derivatives - Other Power Functions
  **** *We are shown the 1/x function, which has the derivative of a hyperbola graph. The slope can be written as 
        ((x + delta_x)**-1 - (x)**-1)/delta_x
       *We are shown f'(x) = nx***n-1, if f(x) = x**n
  The Inverse Function and its Derivative
  **** *The inverse function is if a function does a certain thing, then the inverse function undoes that function (ex: if function f
        sends the number 3 to 5, the inverse of function f sends 5 to 3)
       *If you know function f, the derivative is quite easy to get to
  Derivative of Trigonometric Functions
  **** *Derivative of sin(x) is cos(x)
       *Derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x)
       *We are shown an illustration as to why the derivatives of these two functions are what they are; the triangle of change is shown
        between one radial line (line from origin to circle edge) to another which touches the circle edge at a different point; the 
        angle changes slightly, but also there now exists that triangle of change created by the change of angle, which has a base of
        - delta cos x and height of delta sin x (it is - delta for cos because the angle growing means x of the new radial line 
        decreasing, meaning the base of the triangle actually moves in the opposite of the "delta"; similarly, y increases as does the 
        height of the radial line, meaning the height (or sin) of the triangle moves in the direction of "delta"). In trigonometry, the
        cosine of an anle is the adjacent side divided by hypotenuse...for cos of the angle in the video, the adjacent side is 
        delta sin x and the eqn for cos(angle) is delta sin x/hypotenuse, which means delta sin x = hypotenuse * cos(angle); sine of
        an angle is opposite/hypotenuse...for sin of the angle in the video, the opposite side is - delta cos x and the eqn for sin(angle)
        is - delta cos x/hypotenuse, which means - delta cos x = hypotenuse * sin(angle). A key note is the hypotenuse coincides with the 
        arch of the circle and approaches delta of x; this means delta sin x = hypotenuse * cos(angle) can be also written as
        delta sin x = delta x * cos(angle), and - delta cos x = hypotenuse * sin(angle) can also be written as - delta cos x = delta x *
        sin(angle). THEREFORE, we get the derivatives shown above.
  Meaning of the Exponential (e)
  **** *e = 2.71828182...decimal never terminates because it is irriational (can't be expressed as a ratio between two integers)
       *e also equals (1 + (1/n))^n...at 1, it equals 2; at 10, it's 2.59; at 100, it equals 2.705, and at 1000, it equals 2.717; the 
        more it increases, the more it converges to a certain number (2.718)...this is how e can be defined
       *The interesting thing about this function; when f(x) = e^x, f'(x) also equals e(x); makes it important in science, statistics,
        probability, etc
       *Shown relevance with interest rate...the more ofen interest is paid, the more you end up receiving; (1 + (1/n))^n definitely
        relates to interest...for example, n equalling 2 would be like starting at a bank with $1 and being paid $.50 ($1/2) twice a year.
  The Derivative of e^x
  **** *Y = e^x is the exponential function, and this function is its own derivative (ex: at point x, height on the curve is e^x; the
        slope of the tangent at that point is also e^x
  The Derivative of log(x)
  **** *We're going to use the knowledge of Euler's number and exponential function e^x, along with the inverse function rule, to
        calculate the logarithmic function
       *What is a logarithm? Define it by this example...euler's number to the power of an unknown value is n; the unknown value is ln(n),
        or the natural log of n (log_e(x)).
       *The fact that e^log(x) = x means f(x) = e^x has inverse f^-1(y) = log(y); if e^log(x) = x, log(e^y) = y. This is because the 
        derivative of f^-1(y) is 1/f'(x)...because x is f^-1(y), the derivative of f^-1(y) is 1/f'(f^-1(y)); therefore, the derivative of 
        log(y) is 1/e^log(y), which can be equated to 1/y.
  Existence of the Derivative
  **** *Not always the case that you can find the derivative of a function at every point; these functions are called NON-DIFFERENTIABLE
        FUNCTIONS
       *For a function to be differentiable at a point, the derivative has to exist for that point; for a function to be differentiable
        at an interval, the derivative has to exist for every point in the interval...at functions like f(x) = |x| (absolute value),
        its nondifferentiable because f(x) equals x if x is greater than/equal to 0, and is -x if x is less than 0 (at 0 it's 
        nondifferentiable because a derivative does not exist for all points in domain; think of a corner where a bunch of lines with
        different trajectories can be drawn off of it); also at piecewise functions where there is a jump discontinuity (y = 2 and 
        y = x+1), derivatives cannot be defined at certain points; also at functions like f(x) = x^1/3 where there are vertical
        tangents running straight-up and parallel
  Properties of the Derivative: Multiplication by Scaler
  **** Example is f = cg, with f being the function and c being the constant...f' = cg'; function multiplies by constant c, and the 
       derivative multiplies by constant c
  Properties of the Derivative: The Sum Rule
  **** *Example is f = g + h; f' = g' + h'...example is if a boat moves at 5 mph and a kid moves at 1 mph, the speed of the child with
        respect to the earth is 6 mph. Velocities can be added together if they move in the same direction.
       *The sum rule says if distances can be added, then velocities can be added; similarly, if functions can be added then derivatives
        can be added
  Properties of the Derivative: The Product Rule
  **** *Example is f = gh; f' = g'h + gh'
  Properties of the Derivative: The Chain Rule
  **** *Example is d/dt of g(h(t)); dg/dt =  dg/dh * dh/dt...this equals g'(h(t)) * h'(t)
       *Example is temperature changing as you climb a mountain (dT/dh)...but also as you climb a mountain time is going by (dh/dt);
        therefore, temperature is changing as time is going by (dT/dh * dh/dt = dT/dt)
       *Good three dimensional graph that showcases the dynamic relationship

* LESSON 2: OPTIMIZATION
  Introduction to Optimization
  **** *Now we need to kno what the tools to calculate derivatives which we have learned useful for?
       *The main use for derivatives is use for optimization
       *Optimization is when you ant to find the max or min value of a function; important in machine learning because we want to find
        the model that provides the best fit for our dataset...to do this you need to calculate error functions that tells us how far
        we are from an ideal model --- when you can minimize the error function you have the best model
       *Example is being on a hot bench in a sauna and moving around until you can find the coolest spot (where you will get hotter
        no matter where you move)
       *Slope at max and min points is always 0
       *Not always true that a point with slope 0 is a max or min (local minima); absolute minimum is the GLOBAL minimum
  Optimization of Squared Loss - The One Powerline Problem
  **** *Build a house to have the least amount of cost for power...if there's one power line, build right there
  Optimization of Squared Loss - The Two Powerline Problem
  **** *If x is a house and a and b are the different powerlines...(x-a)^2 + (x-b)^2 is the total cost...to find the minimum is to find
        the best spot to build the house...it's minimizing the total area of the squares created by the distances (the way to think
        about when things are squared is to make a square of it geometrically (connect the horizontal and vertical), which matches the
        area you got in the calculation
       *Derivative of (x-a)^2 + (x-b)^2 is 2(x-a) + 2(x-b), which is equal to (x-a) + (x-b), or 2x - a - b; equal it to 0, 2x - a - b = 0
        and 2x = a + b, so x = (a+b)/2...this means in the middle of the two lines is the best position\
  Optimization of Squared Loss - The Three Powerline Problem
  **** *(x-a)^2 + (x-b)^2 + (x-b)^2 is the total cost
       *x = (a+b+c)/3
       *In general, the square loss is minimizing (x-a1)^2+...+(x-an)^2; the solution is x = (a1+...+an)/n
  Optimization of Log Loss - Part 1
  **** *Example is coin toss
       *Logarithm of a product is the sum of logarithms
       *Used in classification
  Optimization of Log Loss - Part 2
  **** *Logarithms are better than derivatives because derivatives of products are hard, while derivative of sums are easier, but also
        because products of tiny things are tiny

* WEEK 1 WRAP UP
  Week 1 Conclusion
  **** *We learned what derivatives are, how to calculate them, how to use them for optimization, and how the optimaization process
        translates to machine learning problems...but only in 1 variable; next is doing all of this in more than one variable
