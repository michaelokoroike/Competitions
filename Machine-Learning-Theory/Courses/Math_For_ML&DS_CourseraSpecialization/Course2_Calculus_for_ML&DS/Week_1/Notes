WEEK 1: Derivatives and Optimization

* LESSON 1: DERIVATIVES
  Course Introduction
  **** *We will learn about derivatives, what they mea, how it works, how is it used in machine learning. Learn about advanced
        techniques in Newton's method
       *Machine learning is a lot of minimizing and maximizing functions...this is the main point of calculus (this minimizing and
        maximizing is done with derivatives).
       *Large fraction of machine learning is creating a cost function and minimizing it (this is calculus)...when you want to train 
        a machine learning model, you see the error and try to minimize it using derivatives, gradients, and more.
       *The optimizers are based on calculus.
       *Gradient descent is taking small steps to get lower and lower values.
       *Data can be very high dimensional and move in all different directions.
       *Newton's method is a way to minimize functions as an alternative to gradient descent.
  Machine Learning Motivation
  **** *We'll learn the intuition behind concept of derivative; example is velocity (
       *We'll also learn about linear functions, constant functions, quadratic polynomials, exponential functions, and logarithmic
        functions...we'll learn the derivatives of these
       *We'll learn sum rule, product rule, chain rule, and multiplication by scalars...to find derivatives of more complex functions
       *Derivatives are used to optimize functions (maximize or minimize them)
       *We'll learn about square loss and log loss (two most important loss functions in machine learning)
       *Video shows with line of best fit, you are given the method of predcting a value in a regression problem...shown the difference
        for regression and classification...going to learn the math underlying concepts4
  Motivation to Derivatives - Part 1
  **** *First thing when he thinks abut derivatives is velocity; a derivative is a instantaneous change of rate of a function...in driving
        the function is distance and the derivative is velocity
       *Note: Slope is change in distance/change in time
