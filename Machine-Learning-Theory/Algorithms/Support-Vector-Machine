A. STANDARD/ABBREVIATION USED FOR THE ALGORITHM (good)
-  Support Vector Machine (SVM); also Support Vector Networks, many types

B. INFORMATION PROCESSING STRATEGY OF THE ALGORITHM?
- 1. Dataset with, for example, red and black tags 
- 2. Categories are separated with a curve or line
- 3. Data is transformed using a "kernel function"; boundary is referred to as hyperplane

C. GOAL OF ALGORITHM? (good)
- Build a model that assigns new examples to one category or another (non-probabilistic binary linear classifer, though can be used in a probabilistic setting); maps training examples to points in space so as to maximise the width of the gap between the two categories. 
   
D. METHAPHOR FOR THE ALGORITHM? (good)
- You are a farmer who needs to separate his cows from his wolves with a fence; SVM tries to find that fence.

E. PSEUDOCODE AND/OR FLOWCHART FOR ALGORITHM? (good)
- https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Pseudocode-for-SVM-Classifier_fig1_331875695

F. RULES OF THUMB FOR USING THE ALGORITHM? (good)
- Clear margin of separation between classes
- Good in high dimensional spaces (SVMs are automatically regularized, which prevents overfitting on high dimensions)
- Good when number of dimensions (features) are greater than the number of samples (instances/observations)
- Memory efficient
- Non-large, complex (high dimensional) dataset
- Balanced dataset

G. WHAT TYPE OF PROBLEM IS THE ALGORITHM BEST FOR? (good)
- Used for: See directly above; cancer, text classification, credit fraud, speech recognition, etc

H. BENCHMARK DATASETS USED TO DESCRIBE THE ALGORITHM? (good)
- Healthcare datasets with a large number of predictors; who is at risk of developing cancer
