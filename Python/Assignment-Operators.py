#Information = https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_assignment_operators.asp

#Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

x = 5  #same as x = 5

x += 5 #same as x = x + 5

x -= 5 #same as x = x - 5

x *= 5 #same as x = x * 5

x /= 5 #same as x = x / 5

x %= 5 #same as x = x % 5

x //= 5 #same as x = x // 5

x **= 5 #same as x = x ** 5

x &= 5 #same as x = x & 5

x |= 5 #same as x = x | 5

x ^= 5 #same as x = x ^ 5

x >>= 5 #same as x = x >> 5

x <<= 5 #same as x = x << 5
