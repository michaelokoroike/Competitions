# Operators

# (addition)
# - (subtraction)
# * (multiplication)
# / (division)
# % (modulus)
# ** (exponentiation)
# // (floor division)


# Examples

print(1+1) #addition
print(1-1) #subtraction
print(1*1) #multiplication
print(1/1) #division
print(5//2) #floor division - will print 2, as five goes into two 2 total times
print(1**1) #exponentiation
print(5%2) #modulus - will print one as remainder, as five goes into two 2 times, with 1 as a remainder


# Precedence

# Order (and how Precedence is involved)

x = 1+2*3 
print(x) #x = 7

x = (1+2)*3
print(x) #x = 9
