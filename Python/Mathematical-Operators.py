# Operators

+ #(addition)
- #(subtraction)
* #(multiplication)
/ #(division)
// #(modulus)
** #(exponentiation)


# Examples

print(1+1) #addition
print(1-1) #subtraction
print(1*1) #multiplication
print(1/1) #division
print(5//2) #modulus - will print out the remainder of the equation (example = 3 goes into 2 two times, with 1 as the remainder; 1 would be printed)
print(1**1) #exponentiation


# Precedence

# Order (and how Precedence is involved)

x = 1+2*3 
print(x) #x = 7

x = (1+2)*3
print(x) #x = 9
