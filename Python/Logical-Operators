#Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements

x = 10

print(x<5 and x<10) #'and' returns True if both statements are true (False because x is not less than 5 or 10)

print(x<5 or x<11) #'or' returns True if either of the statements are true (True because x is less than 11)

print(not(x<5)) #returns True if the statement within parentheses is false (True because x is 'not' less than 5)
